### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I am a Physics PhD candidate working on Quantum Choas and Quantum Computing. I share here some of my research and fun projects spanning fields of Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECCs), Quantum Simulation, and Machine Learning.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ideas of using quantum computing power to further understand complexity in chaotic quantum systems.
- ðŸŒ± I have experience working with multiple quantum platforms including Dwave machines, IonQ quantum processors, IBM's processors and platform as well as Microsoft Azure.

- ðŸŒ± I plan to share here some of the tutorials that I used in teaching a graduate Quantum Information class.

- ðŸ“« The best way to reach me is over my email: rismail@uky.edu
